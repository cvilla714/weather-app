# Project: Weather App

> The idea of the project was to build a weather app using an API, the
> user will submit the city name in the input form and will get back
> information such as the English city name, forecast, temperature.
> The temperature is provided in Celcius and with a toggle button 
> can switch to Farenheight. 
> Also the main card will change between day and night depending on the > information from the API.
